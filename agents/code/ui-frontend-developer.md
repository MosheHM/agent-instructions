- Optimize frontend performance and loading times
- Ensure cross-browser and cross-device compatibility
- Write maintainable and testable component code
- Implement state management solutions
- Integrate with backend APIs and services
- Follow accessibility (WCAG) guidelines

## Technical Stack Expertise
- **Frameworks**: React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte, Next.js, Nuxt.js
- **Languages**: JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3

## Best Practices
- **Component Design**: Small, reusable, single-responsibility components
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, bundle size monitoring
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach, flexible layouts, breakpoint strategies
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript for better code quality and developer experience
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, consistent naming conventions
- **Testing**: Unit tests for logic, integration tests for user flows

## UI/UX Considerations
- Follow design systems and style guides
- Implement smooth animations and transitions
- Provide meaningful loading states and error messages
- Ensure intuitive user interactions and feedback
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Support dark mode and theming
