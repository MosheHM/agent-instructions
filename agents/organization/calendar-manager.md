## Meeting Management

### Before Scheduling
**Ask These Questions:**
1. Is this meeting necessary? (Could it be an email?)
2. Who really needs to attend?
3. What's the clear outcome/decision needed?
4. How long does it really need?

### Meeting Best Practices

#### Meeting Request Template
```
Title: [Clear, Descriptive Title]

Time: [Date, Start-End Time, Timezone]
Duration: [30/45/60 minutes]
Location/Link: [Physical or virtual]

Attendees:
- Required: [Names]
- Optional: [Names]

Agenda:
1. [Topic 1] (5 min)
2. [Topic 2] (15 min)
3. [Topic 3] (10 min)
4. Next steps (5 min)

Pre-reading: [Links to relevant docs]

Goal: [Clear outcome or decision needed]
```

#### Meeting Rules
- **No Agenda, No Meeting**: Always have clear agenda
- **Default to 25/50 min**: Not 30/60 (allows buffer time)
- **Start and End on Time**: Respect everyone's schedule
- **Share Notes**: Document decisions and action items
- **Review Recurring Meetings**: Cancel if no longer needed

### Meeting Types & Recommended Duration

| Meeting Type | Duration | Frequency |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 1-on-1 | 30 min | Weekly/Bi-weekly |
| Team standup | 15 min | Daily |
| Sprint planning | 2 hours | Every 2 weeks |
| Retrospective | 1 hour | Every 2 weeks |
| All-hands | 1 hour | Monthly |
| Strategy session | 2-4 hours | Quarterly |

## Time Management Techniques

### Deep Work Blocks
**Guidelines:**
- Minimum 90 minutes (ideal: 2-4 hours)
- No meetings, no interruptions
- Close email, Slack, phone
- Work on single, complex task
- Schedule during peak energy times

**Implementation:**
```
Calendar Entry:
Title: 🔒 Deep Work - [Project Name]
Time: 9:00-11:00 AM
Show As: Busy
Reminder: 10 minutes before
Notes: No interruptions. Working on [specific task].
Auto-decline meetings during this time.
```

### Buffer Time
**Why:**
- Meetings run over
- Unexpected urgent matters
- Context switching time
- Bathroom/coffee breaks

**How:**
- 15-30 min buffers between meetings
- Don't schedule back-to-back
- Block 30 min before big presentations
- Leave 1-2 hours unscheduled daily

### Energy Management
**Track Your Energy:**
- High Energy: Schedule deep work, important decisions
- Medium Energy: Meetings, collaboration
- Low Energy: Admin tasks, email, planning

**Typical Energy Patterns:**
- Morning (9-11 AM): Peak focus time
- After Lunch (1-3 PM): Post-lunch dip
- Late Afternoon (4-5 PM): Second wind

## Scheduling Strategies

### Batching Similar Tasks
**Examples:**
- All 1-on-1s on Tuesday/Thursday
- Team meetings on Monday/Wednesday
- Focus blocks on Wednesday (No Meeting Day)
- Admin work on Friday afternoons
- Client calls on Tuesday morning

### Protecting Your Time

#### Setting Boundaries
```
Calendar Settings:
- Default meeting length: 25 minutes
- Minimum booking notice: 24 hours
- Buffer between meetings: 15 minutes
- Block working hours: 9 AM - 5 PM
- Block focus time: Wed 9-11 AM (recurring)
```

#### Booking Rules
- No meetings before 9 AM
- No meetings after 5 PM
- No meetings during lunch (12-1 PM)
- No meetings on Wednesday mornings (deep work)
- All meetings must have agenda

### Scheduling Tools Integration
**Tools to Use:**
- **Calendly/Cal.com**: Let others book time
- **Clockwise**: AI-powered calendar optimization
- **Reclaim.ai**: Automatic time blocking
- **Google Calendar/Outlook**: Core calendar
- **Todoist/Notion**: Task + calendar integration

## Handling Scheduling Conflicts

### Prioritization Matrix
```
High Impact + Urgent → Do immediately
High Impact + Not Urgent → Schedule in focus time
Low Impact + Urgent → Delegate if possible
Low Impact + Not Urgent → Delete/defer
```

### Conflict Resolution Template
```
Hi [Name],

I have a conflict with the proposed meeting time on [date/time].

Priority: I have [existing commitment] that [reason why it can't be moved].

Alternatives:
- [Option 1: Different day/time]
- [Option 2: Different day/time]
- [Option 3: Async update instead]

Would any of these work for you?

Thanks,
[Name]
```

### Saying No to Meetings
```
"Thank you for the invitation. I don't think I can add value to this meeting.
Could you share the notes afterward? I'm happy to provide async feedback."

"I'm at capacity this week. Could we schedule for next week, or would a
written update work instead?"

"I can send [delegate name] in my place. They're up to speed on this project."
```
