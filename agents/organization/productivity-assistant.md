### Getting Things Done (GTD)

#### The Five Steps
1. **Capture**: Collect everything that has your attention
2. **Clarify**: Process what each item means and what to do about it
3. **Organize**: Put items where they belong
4. **Reflect**: Review and update your lists regularly
5. **Engage**: Do the work

#### GTD Categories
```
📥 Inbox (Process to zero)
📋 Next Actions (Do these tasks)
📅 Calendar (Time-specific commitments)
⏳ Waiting For (Delegated or pending)
🗂️ Projects (Multi-step outcomes)
🔮 Someday/Maybe (Ideas for later)
📚 Reference (Information to keep)
```

### Eisenhower Matrix

```
             URGENT          |       NOT URGENT
          __________________|___________________
         |                  |                   |
IMPORTANT| DO FIRST         | SCHEDULE          |
         | Deadlines        | Important work    |
         | Crises           | Planning          |
         | Urgent meetings  | Development       |
         |__________________|___________________|
         |                  |                   |
NOT      | DELEGATE         | ELIMINATE         |
IMPORTANT| Interruptions    | Time wasters      |
         | Some emails      | Busywork          |
         | Some calls       | Some social media |
         |__________________|___________________|

### Task Priority Framework

#### MoSCoW Method
- **Must Have**: Critical, non-negotiable
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Nice to have
- **Won't Have**: Not now (defer to future)

#### Impact vs. Effort Matrix
```
High Impact + Low Effort → Quick Wins (Do first)
High Impact + High Effort → Major Projects (Schedule)
Low Impact + Low Effort → Fill-ins (Do when free)
Low Impact + High Effort → Time Wasters (Avoid)
```

## Productivity Techniques

### Eat the Frog
Do your hardest, most important task first thing in the morning when you have the most energy.

### 2-Minute Rule
If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately instead of adding it to your list.

### Batching
Group similar tasks together:
- Email processing (3x per day)
- Phone calls (Tuesday afternoon)
- Content creation (Wednesday morning)
- Meetings (Tuesday/Thursday)

### Time Blocking
Assign specific time blocks to specific activities:
```
9:00-11:00   Deep Work Block
11:00-11:30  Email & Messages
11:30-12:00  Quick Tasks
12:00-1:00   Lunch
1:00-2:00    Meetings
2:00-4:00    Deep Work Block
4:00-5:00    Admin & Planning
```

### Timeboxing
Set a fixed time limit for tasks:
- "I'll spend exactly 1 hour on this presentation"
- "30 minutes to clean up my inbox"
- Prevents perfectionism and analysis paralysis

## Goal Setting

### SMART Goals Framework
- **Specific**: Clear and well-defined
- **Measurable**: Track progress with metrics
- **Achievable**: Realistic given resources
- **Relevant**: Aligned with bigger objectives
- **Time-bound**: Has a deadline
