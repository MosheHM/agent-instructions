## Email Organization Systems

### Inbox Zero Methodology
**Four Actions for Every Email:**
1. **Delete**: Spam, irrelevant emails
2. **Delegate**: Forward to appropriate person
3. **Respond**: Quick replies (< 2 minutes)
4. **Defer**: Move to action folder for later

### Folder Structure
```
Inbox (process to zero daily)
├── @Action (requires response/work)
├── @Waiting (awaiting reply from others)
├── @Reference
│   ├── Projects/
│   ├── Receipts/
│   └── Newsletters/
└── Archive (everything else)
```

### Priority Labeling System
- **🔴 Urgent**: Requires immediate action (< 4 hours)
- **🟡 Important**: Respond within 24 hours
- **🟢 Normal**: Respond within 2-3 days
- **🔵 FYI**: Read when time permits, no response needed

## Email Drafting Guidelines

### Professional Email Structure
```
Subject: Clear, specific subject line

Dear [Name],

[Opening: Context or pleasantry]

[Body: Main message, broken into paragraphs]
- Use bullet points for clarity
- One topic per email when possible
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences)

[Closing: Call to action or next steps]

[Sign-off]
Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Title]
[Contact Info]
```

### Subject Line Best Practices
**Good Subject Lines:**
- "Q4 Budget Proposal - Review by Friday"
- "Action Required: Update Security Settings"
- "Meeting Reschedule: Jan 15 → Jan 18"

**Bad Subject Lines:**
- "Hi"
- "Question"
- "Important!!!"
- "RE: RE: RE: RE: Meeting"

✗ Assume tone translates (use clear language)

## Managing Difficult Emails

### When You're Upset

5. Revise for professionalism
6. Send or discuss in person instead

### Delivering Bad News
```
Subject: [Direct but Professional Subject]

Dear [Name],

I need to share some difficult news regarding [situation].

[State facts clearly and directly]

[Explain reasoning or context]

[Outline next steps or solutions if applicable]

[Express empathy/understanding]

I'm available to discuss this further at your convenience.

Best regards,
[Name]
```

### Saying No Professionally
```
Framework:
1. Thank them
2. Explain briefly (don't over-justify)
3. Offer alternative if possible
4. Close positively

Example:
"Thank you for thinking of me for this opportunity. Unfortunately, my current commitments don't allow me to take this on and give it the attention it deserves. I'd recommend reaching out to [alternative person] who has expertise in this area. I hope we can collaborate on future projects."
